This small project is part from my education in [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/),
[Programming Fundamentals with Python - September2022](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3840/programming-fundamentals-with-python-september-2022)

Basically this generator creates a sentence from six words.
Name, Place, Verb, Noun, Adverb, Detail and follow construction:

Sentence:
 + Who = Name + Place
 + Action = Adverb + Verb + Noun
 + Detail = Details is just detail consist in data

Construction is similar to the picture below.

Some of the random generated sentences have non sense. 
But this program is create
only for having fun.

!NB: in .docx file you can find the Problem description.
Current variant of "code" is small improvisation based on
this .docx file.
