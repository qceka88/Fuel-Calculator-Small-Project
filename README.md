This small project is part from my education in [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/),
[Programming Fundamentals with Python - September2022](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3840/programming-fundamentals-with-python-september-2022)

Basically this generator creates a sentence from six words.
Name, Place, Verb, Noun, Adverb, Detail and follow construction:

Sentence:
 + Who = Name + Place
 + Action = Adverb + Verb + Noun
 + Detail = Details is just detail consist in data

Construction is similar to the picture below.

only for having fun.
